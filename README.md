# intro-Self-Driving-Cars
Repository to share my projects of Udacity's intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree. 

## List of Projects

* Project 6: Optimize Histogram Filter
* Project 7: Implement a Route Planner
* Project 8: Traffic Light Classifier

### Project 6: Optimize Histogram Filter

This project consist on optimizing a C++ code. In that project there are 2 main folders (`andy_histogram_filter` and `optimized_code`)

* `andy_histogram_filter` is the original project.
* `optimized_code` has the same functions as `andy_histogram_filter` but this are programmed in a more efficient way.

### Project 7: Implement a Route Planner

This project consists in algorithm that finds the most efficient path from one point to another, trying to emulate the algorithm used by common maps Apps. It is using an _A* Search_ algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook.

### Project 8: Traffic Light Classifier

As the name says, this project implemented on a Jupyter Notebook classifies different images of traffic lights. To classify the images, cv2 is used applying different images filters to make a correct classification. The implemention achieve an accuracy of 99.6% in the Test set.
